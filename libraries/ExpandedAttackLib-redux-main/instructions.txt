The next values can only be overwritten for the weapon item:
-- explanation.
weaponitem.value = default
get function

==================
-- The amount of bolts a party memeber will have, can deal more damage than usual if you crit multiple times, like in UT.
self.bolt_count = 1
item:getBoltCount()

-- The speed of the bolts.
self.bolt_speed = 8
item:getBoltSpeed()

-- The offset of the bolts from where their original position would be. Can be negative.
self.bolt_offset = 0
item:getBoltOffset()

-- Whether the bolt will keep accelerating, this defines the acceleration speed. Works with bolt_speed.
-- The bolt will have a single frame where they'll stick to the target.
self.bolt_acceleration = 0
item:getBoltAcceleration()

-- When using multiple bolts, this determines their distance between one to another.
-- A number (ex. 80) will make all bolts be at the same distance from one another.
-- A table (ex. {80, 40, 120}) will make each bolt be at a distance separated by this amount, starting from the second (the first one is affected by bolt_offset)
-- In this case, it will be used for 4 or more bolts, where bolts after the 4th will use the last value, which is 120.
-- A table inside the table (ex. {{40, 80}, 60, {40, 60}}) is the same as above, except that if the number is a table of numbers, the distance will be picked randomly from the numbers.
-- So the second bolt would be at a distance of either 40 or 80, the third always 60, and 4th and above 40 or 60.
self.multibolt_variance = 80
item:getMultiboltVariance()


-- Determines how multibolts are spawned.
-- true = "last_bolt":  The next bolt is spawned relative to the last bolt spawned (lower values recommended)
-- false = "first_bolt": The next bolt is spawned relative to the first bolt spawned (higher values recommended, similar to Magical-Glass, this code was done by Sam Deluxe)
self.calculate_multibolt_from_last_bolt = true
